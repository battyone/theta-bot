<a name="functionality"><h2>What can I do</h2></a>
The bot can generate different tasks for student to solve them.

Each task is a C# code, generated by specific algorithms. The student need to guess the code's time complexity.

The bot offers 4 answer options to choose from.

It's also writes all the statistics in the database, and based on this statistics the bot offers more complicated tasks.

<a name="start"><h2>Getting started</h2></a>
Follow [the article](https://core.telegram.org/bots) to create your own telegram bot and to get API_token.

Launch `theta_bot.exe` with following keys
```
.\theta_bot.exe API_token database_filename
```

<a name="extend"><h2>Extensibility</h2></a>
You can add your own generation algorithms by implementing `IGenerator` in them.

Also you can add your own levels (generation patterns) by implementing `ILevel`.
